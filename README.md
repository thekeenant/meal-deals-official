# meal-deals-official

The official version of [https://github.com/thekeenant/meal-deals](https://github.com/thekeenant/meal-deals).

Find deals to the restaurants you love in malls across Malaysia.

This Android application is a demo that was developed during the "Startup Warzone" 14 hour hackathon put on by The Hub @ The University of Wisconsin - Madison. It is partly functional, and uses a Ruby on Rails backend to provide dynamic content.

Meal Deals was designed for malls in Malaysia. The broad spectrum of restaurants and simply the sheer number of them in malls lead us to develop and app that gives restaurants a way to bring deals to consumers easily. Consumers get a great deal and it makes the restaurant decision-making process that much easier.
